# RP2040 PWM/DMA audio

This C library allows playback of audio samples on Raspberry Pi Pico.
It is a fork of Ricardo Massaro's
[pico-audio-demo](https://github.com/moefh/pico-audio-demo), based on an article
by [Greg Chadwick](https://gregchadwick.co.uk/blog/playing-with-the-pico-pt3/).

Please refer to the original code for examples of use.
